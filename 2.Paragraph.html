    <h1>TIME MANAGEMENT</h1>
    <hr />
    <p>
      ‘Time and tide wait for none.’ This age-old saying could not be more
      accurate in today’s time. Managing time is the key to success. Most
      successful people stress the effective use of time and execute work
      according to available time and routine. Nature is the best tutor for
      learning time management. If flowers wither away in winter, they bloom in
      spring and stay in summer. The cycle continues, and it is fantastic how
      nature works with clockwise precision. That is all we need when we manage
      time ourselves. List down tasks that need to be done and the amount of
      time you would want to dedicate so that we can accomplish more and be more
      productive. Success belongs to those who are organised and manage their
      time well. Being organised is an offshoot of time management. When we
      allocate time for a task, we start to prioritise and organise our actions.
      This eventually leads to a cut down on delay and enhances the quality of
      work. Time management is a habit that will grow and ultimately make us
      addicted to it. By striving toward incorporating time management
      techniques in our lives, we will be making an effort to help others too.
      It has a domino effect and works effectively for people who surround us.
