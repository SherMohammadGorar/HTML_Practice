      The hundredth day of school was a huge event for my children when they
      were young. The excitement was exponential in the days before the 100th
      day. Zero the Hero, a masked superhero played by their teacher's fianc√©,
      made a cameo appearance during the 100th-day celebration, which culminated
      in 100th-day projects, 100th-day activities, and 100th-day surprises. The
      significance of the 100th day of school never occurred to me. I was
      knee-deep in cotton, 100 LifeSavers, and 100 Honey Nut Cheerios.

      For years, my vacation wish list has been subtly growing in the Notes app
      on my phone thanks to sidebars in vacation + Leisure magazines, inspiring
      Instagram photos, conversations overheard in coffee shops, and friend
      suggestions. To give them organization, I have divided them into a few
      major groups. That is about it, though. A haphazard collection of
      (wonderful) places to visit. 100 locations to help you plan your next
      vacation. 100 destinations to add to your dream list for travel.
