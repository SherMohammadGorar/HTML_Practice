    <b> &lt; B &gt; Hello Sher Mohammad Gorar</b>
    <p>
      &lt; STRONG &gt; &lt; EM &gt; Every single thing that has ever happened in
      your <strong>life</strong> is preparing you for a <em>moment</em> that is
      yet to come.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lt; MARK &gt; Trying to be someone else is a waste of the person
      <mark>you are</mark>.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lt; DEL &gt;
      <del>People are more what they hide than what they show</del>
    </p>
    <p>
      &lt; INS &gt; Anyone can come into <ins>your life</ins> and say how much
      they love you. It takes someone really special to stay in your life and
      show how much they love you.
    </p>
