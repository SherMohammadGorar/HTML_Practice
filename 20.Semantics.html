            Rawalpindi police have stated that three suspects have been arrested
            after a harrowing video of a girl’s hair being forcibly cut went
            viral on social media.

          The video, which has been making the rounds on social media since
          Tuesday, shows a man standing over what appears to be a young girl and
          cutting her hair with a pair of scissors while others in the
          background watch. Subsequently, another video also surfaced on social
          media, purportedly of the victim, in which she alleged that the
          incident occurred one-and-a-half months ago in Rawalpindi’s Christian
          Colony. She also alleged that she was beaten and threatened, adding
          that four men were involved in the incident. In a statement early on
          Tuesday, Rawalpindi police commented on the incident. The statement
          referred to the victim as a “girl”. “A video of a girl being beaten
          and her hair being cut has come forward, after which a video statement
          also came forward,” the statement said.
